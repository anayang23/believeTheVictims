  Description
  -->
<p>With abuse victims, especially verbal abuse victims, they are harder to help. Unlike other abuse victims, they don't necessarily realize that they are being abused because it's subtle. Their emotions are being played with, and they may not realize that things are not what they seem to be. While they may feel bad, they may not recognize it as a way they're being hurt. Ways you can help abuse victims is by spreading the word about verbal abuse. You can also donate to some charities that help with verbal abuse. One is listed on the side already in the dropdown menu. You can do some acts of kindness. They could help save a life or bring back faith to some of these victims who don't realize that feeling bad isn't what they have to be. You can also share your story, if you too were or are an abuse victim. Those are just a few ways to help. Researching more about the topic and understanding how to help them is the next step. Please help anyway you can because verbal abuse is deadly.</p>
