  <!--
  Misconceptions
  -->
<p>Some misconceptions about the cause to help verbally abused victims is that the cause is towards putting abusers behind bars or towards ruining relationships between family, friends, or significant others. That is far from the case. The cause towards helping verbally abused victims is to get them out of the environment and into a safe place where they realize that they are loved.</p>

  <!--
  Solutions
  -->
  <p>Some possible temporary solutions include: setting boundaries, therapy, and helping them understand where you aer. Some long-term solutions that many victims work up to is breaking the cycle by cutting their abusers off from their lives and understanding what not to do. Remember, you can still cut them out of your life even if you love them. That will never change your love of them, but it does show that you are mature enough to realize that they are not good for your health and that you deserve better than to feel bad.</p>
