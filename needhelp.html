  Description
  -->
<p>It's hard to deal with realizing that you have been abused. Your emotions were being played with, and you may not realize that things are not what you seem to be. However, verbal abuse can be deadly. If you need any help, there are other resources. If you need free counsel, any hotlines, a self-care app, or even some grounding right now, they are all in the dropdown menu. There are others like you that have struggled through the same thing. If you want to see their stories, please look at them. You are loved and are worthy of love. Do not forget that.</p>
