      <p>Nothing will change unless you find your voice. It doesn't have to go from meekness to standing up to every opinion in one day. It can come over time. Take a deep breath and fight back. You are stronger than them. You have to set boundaries and one day, strive to cut them off. You can love someone and still have to realize that they are harmful to your well-being. You are worthy of love, even when they make you feel like you aren't. Please look out for yourself before you look out for others. It will be so hard, difficult beyond belief, but you will have people that will support you, and those are the people you should learn to love and trust.</p>

      <p>Nothing they do will ever make up for the fact that they hurt you. Nothing you do will ever get rid of the feeling that they hurt you. You cannot associate with them if you want to move on. You will feel so much happier once you find a way to never talk to them. I promise that everything will be okay in the end, even if it seems hard.</p>

      <p>I always thought it was my fault. I thought there was something wrong with me. It's not. Most of the time, it's generational, or due to different circumstances. You are heard. You're not alone. You're seen and loved, maybe some don't show it but there are so many other people who do. Take care of yourself and let yourself feel everything you need to. If no one's said it in a while, I'm so proud of you. You're doing amazing things! And if no one's said it today, I love you. You'll get through this. We're in it together.</p>
