      <p>I was six years old when I first started being verbally abused by my mother. It was so confusing for someone so small like me. At every point, I was convinced she hated me. She ignored me anytime I called for her, only answering after I called her name at least 15 times. She yelled at me anytime I made the smallest mistake, but never let me learn, saying I would just mess it up. There were so many insults and thrown comments about my weight, my height, how I would always be ugly, how I needed to get off my phone or stop reading (even though that was my escape). I didn't know what was wrong with me, and it was clear my mother didn't either. Anything I did was gendered. I can't do one thing because I'm a girl, and I should be doing another because I'm one. I was never taught how to tie my hair, or wash the dishes, clean, or do my laundry. I had to be taught by the internet, or by myself, or by my friends. Throughout it all, she took all the credit while invalidating my feelings. I was taught never to cry otherwise I'd be seen as a disrespectful child. Media instilled in us that family would always love us, and that my mother should be my hero, but she never was. As I grew older, she started to pay more attention to me. Not the good type though. She started forcing me to engage in activities I was not at all interested in just because she wanted me to become an engineer. It was exhausting, and yet I kept doing it, trying to earn her validation. I became her puppet. I was unhappy and I felt trapped. Anyone I confided in told me to just stand up for myself, but it was always easier said than done when my mother always brought up the fact that I would've done all that for nothing. I became scared of confrontation. I began to feel suicidal. I began to trust anyone that wasn't my mother because I wanted to find someone that would stay with me that could be seen as a maternal figure. That trust caused me to be hurt by many other people, especially medical professionals who wanted to help, but ended up spilling everything to the source of the problem. I was seen as an attention seeker and I was asked what was wrong with me. Because of my mother, I cannot talk to someone about my boundaries. Because of her, I cannot handle someone yelling at me or insulting me. She ruined my life and the kid I used to be. I will always be healing and the worst part is I still love her. I want to hate her, but I can't because there's this sense of knowing that she wanted to give me the world. She just never thought to consider that I never wanted the world, and that her ways of forcing it onto me only widened the generational gap between us.</p>

      <p>I became friends with someone in middle school. They were jarring, but I had known them as an acquaintance for a while, so I decided to get to know them. Although I didn't realize it at first, they started to guilt trip me the first time I told them that we could be friends. They mentioned to me about how all their previous friends had left them for being a horrible person--which should've been the first red flag--and I waved it off as they had been nice to me all this time. Their moods were one of two. Either they were super nice to me, to the point where they became touchy and stopped respecting my boundaries, or they were super mean to me and constantly hiding insults behind "sorry I'm just being honest" or "I knew you didn't like blunt people". They confessed their romantic attraction to me the next year and continued to make advances despite me telling them that I was never going to like them back romantically. They would constantly drag themselves down and when given advice by me, would never take it. Gaslighting me into believing that I never gave them advice, I felt alone. I felt like I could never talk to anyone about how I felt about this friend because everyone else seemed to like them as well. I felt like something was wrong with me for not liking my own friend. I never felt happy, only anxious when I realized I had to hang out with them. It never got better until quarantine. I learned about verbal abuse and I realized that the way I'm feeling was not normal. With that, I started to try and distance myself. It being quarantine was a lot easier. However, it stopped being easier when the mandate was lifted. They started visiting me again and since we had a lot of shared friends, we had to talk more. It was harder, but I continued to separate myself. No matter what they told me they'd do, I found myself being happier without them and I realized I had been focusing on their happiness more than mine for a long time.</p>

      <p>Ever since I was little, my dad's family always treated me differently than everyone else. Their conversations with me would be short and blunt, always talking about my academics. Specifically how I always fell short of being "perfect". I really started to notice things when my mom stopped going to family functions with my dad's family. I think I was about 6 or 7. My aunt would invade my privacy, opening letters that were mine, looking at MY grades and bashing me at every opportunity she had. I was sitting in the same room when she told my cousin, "you're the only one who can take your sister's place when she goes to college. You're the only one smart enough. No one can be as good as her but <i>you</i>, make the family proud." My aunt would tell me that crying was for the weak, so I made myself stop crying. She told me that I should play a real sport like my cousin (I was dancing at the time). My aunt told me I should stop being so picky with food - to which I ate more - then she told me to stop eating so much because I was getting bigger, she actually told me that I'd die if i kept eating the way i did. She knowingly left me out of family pictures. She stopped giving me cards for my birthday or even saying it. I heard her validating racist comments toward one of my cultures. Then I saw things with my dad. I was about 10 when I noticed we didn't have a great relationship anymore. Whenever we'd talk about things, he'd always talk over me. He'd tell me I was wrong and keep yelling at me. He was never satisfied with everything I did. He dismissed me whenever I'd try to show him something I was proud of. He would tell me that I didn't know anything because I was a kid. He validated my aunt treating me the way she did because "that's how we show love". He told me I wasn't capable of going out with my friends because something would happen to me. I stopped going out and stayed home, then he got mad because I never went out and I didn't have friends. My dad would tell me to put more and more on my plate during school because I needed to get a good paying job. So I did, I burned myself out and I asked him why I felt horrible all the time and he'd tell me it was normal and I shouldn't complain if I wasn't trying to fix it. He told me that things are much worse when I'm older so I should stop being so self-centered and appreciate what I have. So I stopped complaining, I cried alone in my room at night hoping he wouldn't hear me and get upset because "crying is a weakness". I was never enough for him every time. I became extremely self-critical and I didn't accept anything less than perfection. I bent over backwards to be perfect, jeopardizing my mental and physical health. When my dad saw this, he told me I was only feeling this bad because I thought too much about things. His advice? Stop thinking about it. I'd hear him talking to my mom about how he thought there was something wrong with me because I wasn't confident, I was super quiet all the time and that wouldn't get me a good paying job. There was a time when i was sitting at the same table with him and he said, "its so difficult to have a girl, they always spend so much time at target wasting money and time. Thats why i never go with them (me and my sister)." He told me that he feels like he can never say anything to me without getting attacked because I would talk back. He said he didn't want to spend time with me because I'd only start arguing with him. When my grandma died, I wrote her a letter to bury with her, I asked that no one open it. My dad did. And sent pictures of what I wrote to his family. When I started talking about college, he told me I shouldn't waste my hard work going to community College because people would think badly of me. I had a whole plan I just wanted him to acknowledge and he tore it down. Because of him, I'm an extreme perfectionist, I have trust issues and I struggle with anxiety. I've only ever wanted to be noticed by him. For my dad to tell me genuinely that he was proud of me and I was doing enough. I am tired of the comparing to the "smarter, better, wealthier, more accomplished" people. I just want him to hear me. There's so much I probably forgot to say but this is a fraction of what I've gone (and still) going through.</p>
